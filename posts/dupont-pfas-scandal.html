                    <p class="intro-text">It started with cattle dying in Parkersburg, West Virginia. It ended with the
                        revelation that a chemical found in the blood of 99% of Americans was known to be toxic by its
                        manufacturer for decades.</p>

                    <p>In this chilling investigation, <strong>Veritasium</strong> exposes the story of PFOA (C8), the
                        miracle chemical behind Teflon, and the lengths DuPont went to keep its dangers a secret.</p>

                    <h2>1. The Miracle Molecule</h2>
                    <p>PFOA is a surfactant that makes things slippery and water-resistant. It was the secret sauce
                        behind Teflon pans, waterproof jackets, and stain-resistant carpets. It was a goldmine for
                        DuPont. But the carbon-fluorine bond that makes it so useful also makes it indestructible.</p>

                    <h2>2. The "Forever Chemical"</h2>
                    <p>Because these chemicals don't break down in nature, they accumulate. They are now known as PFAS
                        (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances). Internal documents revealed that DuPont knew:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>PFOA caused cancer and birth defects in lab animals.</li>
                        <li>It was accumulating in the blood of their workers.</li>
                        <li>It had contaminated the local water supply.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Yet, they continued production. This echoes the corporate negligence seen in the <a

                    <h2>3. The Legal Battle</h2>
                    <p>Rob Bilott, a corporate defense attorney, spent decades fighting DuPont. His work uncovered the
                        "C8 Science Panel," which definitively linked C8 exposure to six diseases, including kidney
                        cancer and thyroid disease.</p>
                    <p>Today, PFOA is largely phased out, but replaced by "GenX" chemicals—which scientists fear may be
                        just as dangerous. It's a game of chemical whack-a-mole.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>The legacy of Teflon isn't just non-stick pans; it's a global contamination crisis. It forces us
                        to ask: what is the true cost of convenience? And what other "miracle" materials are silently
                        accumulating in our veins?</p>
