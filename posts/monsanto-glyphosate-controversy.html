                    <p class="intro-text">Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in human history. Marketed as
                        "Roundup," it changed modern agriculture. But beneath the success story lies a dark narrative of
                        corporate influence, suppressed data, and questionable science.</p>

                    <p>In a gripping investigation, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxVXvFOPIyQ"
                            target="_blank" rel="noopener">Veritasium</a> uncovers how Monsanto (now Bayer)
                        allegedly ghostwrote scientific papers, bullied dissenters, and planted stories to protect their
                        billion-dollar product from cancer classifications.</p>

                    <h2>1. The IARC Classification</h2>
                    <p>In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as
                        "probably carcinogenic to humans." This sparked a massive counter-offensive from Monsanto.
                        Internal emails later revealed a strategy to "orchestrate an outcry" against the IARC findings.

                    <h2>2. Ghostwriting & "Independent" Science</h2>
                    <p>The "Monsanto Papers," released during litigation, showed company scientists editing and even
                        writing parts of papers that were published under the names of independent academics. This
                        created an echo chamber of safety assurances that appeared to come from neutral third parties
                        but were, in fact, crafted by the manufacturer.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The Strategy:</strong> Identify "friendly" scientists to lend their names to
                            industry-written drafts.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Goal:</strong> Create a body of "scientific literature" that regulators would
                            rely on to keep the product on the market.</li>

                    <h2>3. The Human Cost</h2>
                    <p>While the legal battles rage on with billion-dollar settlements, the question of public health
                        remains. Whether glyphosate is definitely carcinogenic is still debated, but the
                        <em>tactics</em> used to influence that debate are now clear. It serves as a stark warning about
                        the intersection of profit and peer review.

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Science relies on transparency. When that transparency is manipulated by corporate interests, the
                        very foundation of public trust erodes. The story of Monsanto is not just about a chemical; it's
                        about the integrity of the scientific process itself.</p>
