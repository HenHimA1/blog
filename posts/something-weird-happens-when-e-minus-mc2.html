                    <p class="intro-text">We all know Einstein's most famous equation: E=mc². It tells us that energy
                        and mass are equivalent. But what happens if we flip the sign? What does it mean for mass to be
                        <em>negative</em>?

                        discover that negative mass isn't just a sci-fi trope—it's a real phenomenon that underpins all
                        modern electronics.</p>

                    <h2>1. The Concept of Effective Mass</h2>
                    <p>In a vacuum, an electron behaves as you'd expect. But inside a crystal lattice (like silicon), it
                        interacts with the atoms around it. These interactions can make it accelerate faster or slower
                        than expected for a given force.</p>
                    <p>Physicists describe this by assigning the electron an <strong>"effective mass."</strong>
                        Sometimes, this mass can be zero. Even stranger, it can be negative.</p>

                    <h2>2. Electron Holes and Negative Mass</h2>
                    <p>When an electron in a crowded valence band moves, it leaves behind a vacancy called a "hole."
                        This hole acts like a positively charged particle. But mathematically, it behaves exactly like a
                        particle with <strong>negative mass</strong> responding to forces in the opposite direction.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Newton's Second Law Flipped:</strong> For a negative mass, applying a force to the
                            right causes it to accelerate to the left.</li>
                        <li><strong>Semiconductors:</strong> This counter-intuitive property is essential for the
                            operation of transistors, diodes, and microchips.</li>

                    <h2>3. Why It Matters</h2>
                    <p>Without understanding this "weird" physics, the digital revolution wouldn't exist. Every time you
                        use a computer or smartphone, you are harnessing the power of particles that act as if they have
                        negative mass.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Physics often defies common sense. E=-mc² isn't about antigravity engines (yet), but about the
                        subtle, quantum behaviors that govern the material world. It reminds us that reality, at its
                        core, is far Stranger than fiction.</p>
